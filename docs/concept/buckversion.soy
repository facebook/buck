If the root of your project contains a file named <code>.buckversion</code>,
then Buck will expect that file to contain a Git hash that specifies the
version of Buck that should be used to build your project.

<p>

If <code>.buckversion</code> is present, then <code>bin/buck</code> will
compare the value in <code>.buckversion</code> with the value of
{sp}<code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> in the directory where you checked out
Buck from Git. If the values differ, then Buck will update itself to the
revision that you specified (using <code>git fetch</code> and
{sp}<code>git checkout</code>), and then rebuild itself.

<p>

If <code>.buckversion</code> is not present, then Buck assumes it is at
the correct revision. In that scenario, <code>bin/buck</code> will only
rebuild Buck if the compiled <code>.class</code> files for Buck are not present.

<p>

At Facebook, Buck has undergone rapid change, so if a new version of
a binary version of Buck needed to be checked to the projects that use it
every time Buck were updated, then those projects' version control histories
would be littered with Buck binaries. Relying on this
{sp}<code>.buckversion</code> scheme has made it possible to keep those
repositories free of Buck binaries while iterating quickly on Buck.

<p>

To disable this behavior, you can either:

<ul>
  <li>Remove the <code>.buckversion</code> file.
  <li>Add a <code>.nobuckcheck</code> file.
      See the article on{sp}
      <a href="{ROOT}concept/nobuckcheck.html"><code>.nobuckcheck</code></a>{sp}
      for details
</ul>

Note that normally, a Git hash in <code>.buckversion</code> will be one
on the master branch of Buck as hosted by Facebook on GitHub.
However, if you create your own fork of Buck that developers check out,
then this scheme should work just as well with the hashes from your forked repo.
