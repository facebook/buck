    {param description}
      A command that builds one or more specified targets.

{call buck.command}
{param overview}

<p>
Builds one or more rules specified by a set 
of {call buck.build_target /}s and  {call buck.build_target_pattern /}s. 
This is the most commonly used command in Buck. 
</p>

<p>
Syntax:
</p>

<pre>buck build &#123; &lt;build target&gt; &#124; &lt;build target pattern&gt; &#125; . . .</pre>
<p>
Example:
</p>

<pre>buck build /&#x2F;java/com/example/app:amazing</pre>

<p>
  Note that any {call buck.remote_file /} rules referenced by your build rules must be downloaded
  with {call buck.cmd_fetch /} prior to calling this command unless you set <code>in_build = true
  </code> in the <code>[download]</code> section of your {call buck.concept_buckconfig /}.
</p>

{param params}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'build-report' /}
  {param desc}
  Specifies a file where a JSON summary of the build output should be written.
  Note that <code>--build-report</code> can be used without <code>--keep-going</code>,
  though if <code>--keep-going</code> is not specified, the generated report may be partial and not
  include information about the targets that buck haven't had a chance to try to build.
  Here is a sample build report:
  <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">{literal}
{
  "success": false,
  "results": {
    "//fake:rule1": {
      "success": true,
      "type": "BUILT_LOCALLY",
      "output": "buck-out/gen/fake/rule1.txt"
    },
    "//fake:rule2": {
      "success": false
    },
    "//fake:rule3": {
      "success": true,
      "type": "FETCHED_FROM_CACHE"
    }
  }
}
{/literal}</pre>
  <p>
  In this example, both <code>//fake:rule1</code> and <code>//fake:rule3</code> were
  built successfully, but only <code>//fake:rule1</code> had an output file
  associated with the rule.
  <p>
  Note that this contains the same information that <code>--keep-going</code> prints
  to the console, but is easier to parse programmatically. This report may contain
  more fields in the future.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'keep-going' /}
  {param desc}
  When specified, Buck will attempt to build all targets specified on the command line,
  even if some of the targets fail. (Buck's default behavior is to exit immediately when
  any of the specified targets fail.)
  <p>
  <p>
  When <code>--keep-going</code> is specified, a report of the build will be printed to
  stderr, detailing the build status of each target. Each line of the report represents
  the status of one build target, which has up to four columns:
  <ol>
    <li><code>OK</code> or <code>FAIL</code>, as per the success of the build rule.
    <li>The build target of the rule.
    <li>If successful, the type of the success as defined by the{sp}
      <a href="http://buckbuild.com/javadoc/com/facebook/buck/rules/BuildRuleSuccess.Type.html">
        <code>com.facebook.buck.rules.BuildRuleSuccess.Type</code>
      </a> enum.
    <li>If successful, the path to the output file of the rule, if it exists.
  </ol>
  For example, if Buck were run with the following arguments:
  <p>
  <pre>buck build
  --keep-going {nil}//fake:rule1 {nil}//fake:rule2 {nil}//fake:rule3</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
  Then the report printed to stderr might look like:
  <p>
  <pre>
  OK   {nil}//fake:rule1 BUILT_LOCALLY buck-out/gen/fake/rule1.txt{\n}
  FAIL {nil}//fake:rule2{\n}
  OK   {nil}//fake:rule3 FETCHED_FROM_CACHE{\n}
  </pre>
  <p>
  In this example, both <code>//fake:rule1</code> and <code>//fake:rule3</code> were
  built successfully, but only <code>//fake:rule1</code> had an output file
  associated with the rule. Admittedly, the state of column 1 could be derived from
  the presence of column 3, but the encoding of column 1 makes it easier to filter
  out successful rules from failed ones.
  <p>
  Note that when <code>--keep-going</code> is specified, the exit code will be
  0 only if all targets were built successfully.
  <p>
  This option is analogous to <code>-k/--keep-going</code> in Make.
 {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'out' /}
  {param desc}
  Takes the output of the build target and copies it to the specified path.
  Only works with a single build target, and the corresponding build rule
  must support this option.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'populate-cache' /}
  {param desc}

  Performs a cache population, which makes the output of all unchanged transitive dependencies available 
  (if these outputs are available in the remote cache). Does not build changed or unavailable dependencies locally.
 {/param}
{/call}


{call buck.param}
  {param name: 'verbose' /}
  {param alias: 'v'/}
  {param desc}
  How verbose logging to the console should be, with 1 as the minimum
  and 10 as the most verbose.
