{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'name' /}

    A descriptive name for the rule.  If this is the only parameter to the{sp}
    <code>export_file()</code> code, this must be the path to the file.
  {/param}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'src' /}
  {param default: 'None' /}
  {param desc}
    The path to the file that should be exported.

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'out' /}
  {param default: 'None' /}
  {param desc}
    The name which the file will be called if another rule depends on it instead of the name it
    already has.

  {param desc}
    How files are referenced internally in buck. 
    If set to 'copy', then a full copy will be made into the new location in buck-out.
    If set to 'reference', the original file will be used by internal build rules in-place. 
    However, this mode does not work across repositories or if the 'out' property is set.
    For read-only operations, 'reference' can be more performant.

{param examples}

<p>
  The best way to see how the <code>export_file()</code> rule works is with some examples.  The
  common case is:
</p>

{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
export_file(
  name = 'example.html',
)

# This is equivalent to

export_file(
  name = 'example.html',
  src = 'example.html',
  out = 'example.html',
)
</pre>
{/literal}

<p>
  It is sometimes useful to refer to the file not by its path, but by a more logical name:
</p>

{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
export_file(
  name = 'example',
  src = 'example.html',
)

# This is equivalent to

export_file(
  name = 'example',
  src = 'example.html',
  out = 'example.html',
)
</pre>
{/literal}

<p>
  Finally, there are occasions where you want to export a file more than once but want to copy it to
  a different name for each output:
</p>

{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
export_file(
  name = 'runner',
  src = 'RemoteRunner.html',
)

export_file(
  name = 'runner_hta',
  src = 'RemoteRunner.html',
  out = 'RemoteRunner.hta',
)
</pre>
{/literal}

<p>
  Using the <code>export_file()</code> rule is also simple:
</p>

{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
export_file(
  name = 'example',
  src = 'example.html',
)

genrule(
  name = 'demo',
  out = 'result.html'
  cmd = 'cp $(location :example) $OUT',
)
</pre>
{/literal}

{/param}

{/call}  // End of buck.rule
