{param overview}
  <p>A <code>test_suite()</code> is used to create a grouping of tests that should all be run by just testing this rule.</p>

  <p>This rule can then be given to <code>buck test</code>, and all tests that it depends on will be invoked.
  Note that the test_suite() target is not tested itself, it just tells buck to run other
  tests. It will not show up in calls to the external runner nor in the normal test output.</p>

This test_suite() sets up two different sets of tests to run, 'all' tests and 'slow' tests. Note that <code>all_tests</code> can depend on <code>slow_tests</code>, and all three tests are run.
