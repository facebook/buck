    {param description}
      A rule that is used to define a set of kotlin files that contain tests.
    {/param}
    {param content}

{call buck.rule}
{param status: 'UNFROZEN' /}
{param overview}
A <code>kotlin_test()</code> rule is used to define a set of
{sp}<code>.kt</code> files that contain tests to run via JUnit.
{/param}

{param args}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'name' /}
  {param desc}
  The name of the rule.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'srcs' /}
  {param default : '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  Like <code>{call buck.kotlin_library /}</code></a>,
  all of the <code>.kt</code> files specified by the
  {sp}<code>srcs</code> argument will be compiled when this rule is
  built. In addition, all of the corresponding <code>.class</code>{sp}
  files that are built by this rule will be passed as arguments to
  JUnit when this rule is run as a test. <code>.class</code> files
  that are passed to JUnit that do not have any methods annotated with
  {sp}<code>@Test</code> are considered failed tests, so make sure that
  only test case classes are specified as <code>srcs</code>. This is
  frequently done by specifying <code>srcs</code> as
  {sp}{literal}<code>glob(['**/*Test.kt'])</code>{/literal}.
