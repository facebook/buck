Local modifications:
 - Only imported the pex source (no tests/docs).
 - Disabled the part of the twitter PEX code that auto-detects the setuptools package from the
   system, as this got more problematic to fake in our own `pkg_resources` module.
 - Fixed usage of os.link (does not exist on windows).
 - Fixed prebuilt package resolution when pexs have '#' in the name.
 - Added the ability to not hash the contents of the pex (used for in-place builds).
 - Added support for directory resources
 - Back-ported Python 3.6 compatibility commit c5ab73fd4d8e816e21a89d48c8d0c8095ef5a49c
 - Back-ported namespaced packages fix, commit 7d2dc7f500aa7ae227c3ddca4b278b807d353a5e
 - Fixed Python 3 issue with writing bytes to a text file (`with open(path, 'wb') as fp:` on line 68 in `compiler.py`)
