"""Skylib module containing common set algorithms.

CAUTION: Operating on sets, particularly sets contained in providers, may
asymptotically slow down the analysis phase. While constructing large sets with
addition/union is fast (there is no linear-time copy involved), the
`difference` function and various comparison predicates involve linear-time
traversals.

For convenience, the functions in this module can take either sets or lists as
inputs; operations that take lists treat them as if they were sets (i.e.,
duplicate elements are ignored). Functions that return new sets always return
them as the `set` type, regardless of the types of the inputs.
