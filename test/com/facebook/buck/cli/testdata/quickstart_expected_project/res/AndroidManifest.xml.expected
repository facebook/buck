  This is the default AndroidManifest.xml used by Android library projects in
  IntelliJ, as such projects need only the package attribute in order to
  decide which Java package to use for the generated R.java file.

  Because we use "com.facebook" as the package for all of our R.java files,
  we can share the same AndroidManifest.xml for all of our our library projects.
  This helps keep the /java/ directory clear of cruft.

  There is a task filed to make Buck more flexible in terms of how we generate
  R.java files:
