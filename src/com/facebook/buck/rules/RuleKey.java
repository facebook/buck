/**
 * RuleKey encapsulates regimented computation of SHA-1 keys that incorporate all BuildRule state
 * relevant to idempotency. The RuleKey.Builder API conceptually implements the construction of an
 * ordered map, and the key/val pairs are digested using an internal serialization that guarantees
 * a 1:1 mapping for each distinct vector of keys
 * &lt;header,k1,...,kn&gt; in RuleKey.builder(header).set(k1, v1) ... .set(kn, vn).build().
 * <p>
 * Note carefully that in order to reliably avoid accidental collisions, each RuleKey schema, as
 * defined by the key vector, must have a distinct header. Otherwise it is possible (if unlikely)
 * for serialized value data to alias serialized key data, with the result being identical RuleKeys
 * for differing input. In practical terms this means that each BuildRule implementer should specify
 * a distinct header, and that for all RuleKeys built with a particular header, the sequence
 * of set() calls should be identical, even if values are missing. The set() methods specifically
 * handle null values to accommodate this regime.
